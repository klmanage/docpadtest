###The Dangers of Password Reuse

With the increasing use of online services for a whole multitude of things like banking, email, shopping, social networking etc. we are having to create and manage more and more user accounts.
Even the most trivial of sites encourage users to register and create an account on their site if only in order to better track and gather data about usage profiles etc. Nonetheless, 
the more of these services we use and the more accounts we have to setup and manage then the greater the likelihood that we will be tempted to reuse account information, i.e. the same login and password, across multiple accounts.

The reason for this is very simple. It is very difficult to remember multiple passwords. But, however difficult it is, we have to realise the risks that this poses. it is vital that all of us understand why reuse of passwords is such a risky business. Once we realise this we can look at ways to mitigate that risk and make the management of multiple accounts easier and safer.
So, why is it so risky?
     
The best example is probably Gmail. It has become very common for people to have a Gmail account if for no other reason than the need to provide an email address when setting up accounts with online service providers. Increasingly, these sites will explicitly ask you to provide an email address as your username. This means that in many cases when a site is compromised and accounts are stolen the attackers first port of call will be to try and access your email account using the password they have aquires. If you have used the same password then they will now have 'admin' access to your email account. The first thing they will do is to change the password which prevents you from accessing the site. The next thing they will do is go through your emails looking for 'confirmation' messages from sites you have created accounts on. If any of those sites look interesting they will go there and again try the password. If it doesn't work they simply hit the forgot password link and wait for the email to arrive in the gmail account they now control. Now, they can reset that password and do what they like.
However unlikely this sounds it is a regular occurrence.
The simple rule is "don't reuse passwords".
      
There is not much you can do about reusing usernames, because they tend to be an email address, but there really is no excuse for reusing passwords.
At the very least **never** use the same email/password combination as your real gmail account.


put it I manage to get hold of a password for one of your accounts then I have a very good chance of getting access to sThe moment we do this we are in trouble. Reusing account details, but especially passwords, increases the risk of identity theft many times over.</p><p>If a site you use is compromised and user account details are stolen then those details will often be used to The problem with that is that reusing account information on multiple sites greatly increases the risk of identity theft.
      
We may reason that we only do this for 'nothing' sites. Ones where we don't store any sensitive information. Sites where we don't use our credit card etc.
But this is why these kinds of sites are often targeted. The 'mom and pop' store is usually much easier to compromise than a major service provider like amazon. But precisely because our guard is down these are the places we will most likely use passwords again.
The issue is this: If I can get your password 
You have to assume that the attacker has thought about everything. You have to assume that they have researched user behaviour and that they know the habits and bad practices that users are prey to. 

What about situations where we use third-party accounts like Twitter or Facebook. In those cases the account information never leaves the parent site. If Twitter or Facebook are compromised, which they both have been, then obviously you will be exposed to risk.
It is therefore vital that everyone understands the very real risks that password reuse brings about.

Is it safer to login with a username rather than an email ?
Because of password reuse yes. Because if your email is got then 
they cannot send you a mail warning of suspicious behaviour..
