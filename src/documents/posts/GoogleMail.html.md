### Why you should never reuse your Gmail password for any other online account
*You should never reuse your Gmail account password on any other site, ever.* If you do, and the site in question is compromised by attackers, there is a severe risk that your Gmail account could be hijacked. This kind of account hijacking occurs when a malicious user is able to access your Gmail account, using stolen account iformation, and change the password on the account so that the actual owner is effectively locked out and can no longer access their account.

Once the account is in the hands of an attacker they can do anything they like with it, including deleting the entire account, use it to send viruses and other acts of vandalism. But, the more usual scenario is to use it steal your digital identity:

1. Find information about other online accounts the owner uses.
2. Visit any of these other sites and try the same email/password combination to gain access.
3. If this doesn't work they simply use the password reset function offered by most sites. The resulting 'confirmation' email is sent to the gmail account they now control enabling them to reset the password and take control of that account as well. 

Obviously, there are lots of other things they can do, it depends on what you keep in your webmail, but this is a fairly common occurrence.

If your account is hijacked what can you do?
