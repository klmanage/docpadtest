###Why we are at risk in the first place?
It is important to understand what motivates attackers to steal our identity. Many of our assumptions may be wrong. Money is certainly the biggest factor but there are other reasons.

- effectively, identity theft is a business. It involves markets, customers and products.

- It is competitive like regular business and is subject to the same need to outstrip its competitors.
- In this context government agencies are really just competitors. People with different motives working in the same space. 
- The risk is not so much getting caught as being unable to grow the business. and staying ahead of your competitors.
- Getting caught is not so bad, people are expendable and in any case its the same in any sphere.
- How much energy and resources are put into fighting this type of crime?
- Probaby a lot less than we would like. Government agencies have their own priorities, are engaged in their own competition, and resources are finite.
- seen from this point of view it's easy to see why the situation will only get worse and not better.
- It is entirely possible to live your entire life in this way. And no one need ever know. 
- They don't really care about you. You are just a dollar value.
- Big Data. Companies are increasing the risk by developing ever more sophisticated ways of aggregating data about peoples online activities. They are doing this for business reasons.
- businesses need to compete on the web to make money and often they are in a hurry to get products out there. There are several high profile examples of businesses putting their interests before those of their customers.
- All software has inherent vulnerabilities. If you know what those vulnerabilities are you can exploit them. Better still if you know that in order to patch those vulnerabilities the company will need to release patches and you know that users will not apply them quickly then you have a window to work in. Right now there are millions of targets that are unprotected.
- You may think only big businesses are at risk. But think about it. The easiest way to get account details is to target small inoccuous firms and if you do it right they may never even know they have been hacked.
