###What to do if your account has been compromised

####What do we mean by **compromised**?###
When a website has been compromised it means someone other than the owners has been able to gain access to their webserver and make changes to the site such that they can control its behaviour.
Often the site owner will not even know they have been compromised. Everything looks and behaves as normal with no external signs that anything untoward is happening. As users visit the site it they find no noticeable difference. The main objective is to get the user to download some code to their machine. 

That is people with special skills sitting at a computer carrying out attacks ( the movie image).
When it comes to gathering information for an attack preparation is everything. Hacking is actually quite hard especially if you want to remain undetected. It's often much easier to just ask for information. People are easily duped into providing seemingly trivial information which can be used to triangulate and analyse the data looking for patterns.
