###The difference between hacking and social engineering.
We tend to assume that the biggest danger is from 'hackers'. Computer experts that have deep knowledge of how to exploit systems using code. But often there are easier ways for malicious users to get the information they need. They just need to find a way to get users to provide information.
This is called 'Social Engineering' and the figures are horrendous. It's quite easy to get a lot of information for free simply by asking the right questions in the right order.
Defence against hacking is mostly systematic. We can do a lot to secure our computers and reduce the risk of code-based hacks. Social engineering is different because it involved people  and people can be hacked a bit more easily than computers.

Are there any good examples of social engineering attack vectors

The big danger now is when people don't know that they have been compromised.
