###Why you must **never** use your Gmail/Hotmail password for any other sites.

If you use your webmail password for other sites and one of those sites is compromised you run the risk of having your Gmail account hijacked. This is a *very* bad thing.

Of course, this is not the only way that malicious users can gain access to your account details. Keyloggers are still a very common occurence.


If you find it hard to believe that it is necessary to never use the same password twice let me show you what you would need to do in the event that a malicious user was able to hijack your Gmail/Hotmail account.

1. the first thing you need to do is see if you have been locked out of your account by the attacker. This is usually the first thing an attacker will do once they have your details. If you are lucky and you can still get in then you can follow the following steps:
1. Change the account password.
2. Check your security settings and change them immediately - this is probably how you got done in the first place.
3. Check you account settings. you need to go through and check that now 'forwarders' have been setup. Ways of having all mail sent to the attacker.
4. Check through your emails. How many other sites you use are evinding

* 
* What do you keep in your email. Have a look. Do you have any information relating to other sites you use
such as password reset links.
* Check the security settings on mail and social media accounts. Anyone can easily find Mothers maiden name, town of birth etc. Usually because we've actually published it on Facebook or LinkedIn.
*Social media sites have been hacked and millions of user accounts compromised.Size is no deterrent because the weakest link is always people.

###What you will have to do if your Gmail gets hijacked
*If you are lucky the hijacker may not have changed the password so check that first. If you can still login change the password immediately.
